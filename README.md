*Collaborators:* Matthew Ruiz Diaz, Nathan Ovadia, Nathan Shaver, Nicholas Griffin, Nova White, Zion Washington

*Goal:* This github repo is dedicated to manage the Collegiate dance team recruitment web platform

*Motivation*: Collegiate Dance teams are not NCAA sanctioned therefore they have no central governing system. Teams are transitioning from in person auditions to online recruitment, however, there are no tools for assisting the process. </br >
-  Little funding results in limited resources and time for coaches
-  High personal cost for in person travel and auditions
-  Disorganized emailing process can lead to missed prospects</br >

Studio to Stadium exists to seamlessly unite dancers and coaches across the nation. We strive to facilitate the recruiting process through authentic connections, empowering the individual and providing equal opportunity to all prospects dancers.
